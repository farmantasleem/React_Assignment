    <p>Dear students&nbsp;&nbsp;👋<br />
        <br />
        Greetings to all of you! We hope you are doing well and enjoying your learning journey with us!&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        We have noticed that some of you are taking extra time to grasp the concepts covered in the&nbsp;<strong>JavaScript Fundamental - 1&nbsp;</strong>video. Your dedication to understanding JavaScript is commendable, and we appreciate your efforts to enhance your skills!&nbsp;🎓<br />
        <br />
        To ensure that every student gets a solid understanding of JavaScript without feeling rushed or overwhelmed,</p>
        
        <p>we have decided to make a slight adjustment to our schedule this week.&nbsp;📖<br />
        <br />
        For this week, we won&#39;t be uploading new videos for the<strong>&nbsp;JavaScript Fundamental - 2 module.</strong>&nbsp;We understand that it might be challenging for some of you to keep up with the pace, and we want to provide you with the best learning experience possible.<br />
        <br />
        Instead, we have something special planned just for you!&nbsp;🎉We&#39;ll schedule a live class For you and share the date and time with you shortly on your mail.&nbsp;⏳<br />
        <br />
        We believe that this approach will provide you with the personalized attention you deserve and help you build a strong foundation in JavaScript for your future learning endeavors.&nbsp;<br />
        Stay tuned for the upcoming announcement with all the details about the live class!&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Keep up the fantastic work, and we&#39;ll see you soon in the live class!<br />
        <br />
        Best regards,<br />
